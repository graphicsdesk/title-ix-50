This unprecedented endeavor allowed a women’s college, Barnard, to compete in the NCAA for the first time. The program has since expanded, especially under Barnard President Sian Beilock.

Dianne Murphy was appointed as Columbia’s athletic director by University President Lee Bollinger in 2004. Her 11-year tenure saw 30 Columbia teams receive Ivy League titles. Perhaps her most notable achievement was the Columbia Campaign for Athletics: Achieving Excellence. As the most successful fundraising campaign in Columbia Athletics history, it helped raise over $100 million for the program. – Jorge Hernandez </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>2007: Columbia Athletics Women’s Leadership Council established</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In 2007, M.

Nancy Kalafus, then the head coach of the Lions, led the team to the winningest season in program history. The 21-6 record, achieved in Division III, paved the way for the Lions’ subsequent play in Division I. The team won third place in the NCAA tournament that year with an 89-73 victory over Buffalo State College. Kalafus would coach the Lions for an additional five seasons before her departure in 1991. – Adam Lang </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>1987: Ula Lysniak sets women’s basketball career record</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> As the first Columbia woman to score 1000 points in her career, Ula Lysniak, BC ’87, is one of Columbia basketball’s all-time greats. Lysniak started every game in her four years on the team and is one of the Lions’ all-time leading scorers with 1,447 points. She also added 764 rebounds in her career. After graduating from Barnard in 1987, Lysniak played in Austria as the first Light Blue woman player to ever play professionally. – Rebecca Wachen </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Megan Griffith’s career, from Columbia player to head coach</b> </p> <div class="image-griffith"> <img src="megan-griffith.1310a793.jpeg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:3vh;"> Photo courtesy of Columbia Daily Spectator Archives </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Currently in her seventh season as head coach at her alma mater, Megan Griffith, CC ’07, has transformed Columbia women’s basketball into a team that sits near the top of the Ivy League.

During her own collegiate career, Griffith scored over 1000 points, sitting at eighth on the Columbia all-time scoring leaderboard.

During that reign, the Lions would claim back-to-back individual Heps Championship titles with Caroline Bierbaum, CC ’06, who won it all in 2004 and 2005. Her feat was so impressive that her 2005 5k time still tops Columbia’s record books at 17:01.4. – Alexander Kwok </p> <p class="g-body subhed">Fencing</p> <div class="image-bilodeau"> <img src="bilodeau.cf5356e3.png"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:3vh;"> Photo courtesy of Columbia Daily Spectator Archives </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>1987: Katy Bilodeau repeats as individual national champion</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In 1985, Katy Bilodeau, CC ’87, won the NCAA national title in women’s foil. In 1987, she did it again, becoming the first female fencer to win two NCAA titles. The Columbia Athletics Hall of Famer finished her career as one of the most decorated Lions ever. Among many other honors, she was the first fencer to be a four-time first-team All-American, the 1980s NCAA Athlete of the Decade in fencing, and a two-time Olympian in 1988 and 1992. – Robert Gao </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>1992: First combined national title, three years after NCAA integrates fencing scoring</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> When Columbia won the 1992 NCAA championship, it was the program’s 12th of all time. More importantly though, it was the Lions’ first since the national fencing championships adopted a co-ed model, coming just three years after the NCAA switched to the combined men’s and women’s scoring format and less than a decade after Columbia itself began admitting women in 1983. Three-time Olympian Anne Marsh, CC ’94, played a key role, finishing second in women’s foil with a 14-2 record. Then the Lions won it all again, repeating as national champions in 1993 despite coming in as the underdog. Marsh again put up strong numbers, placing third with a 16-1 record. –Robert Gao </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>2005: Emily Jacobson wins individual title as first-year</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> After competing at the 2004 Olympics, Emily Jacobson, CC ’08, exploded onto the national fencing scene in her rookie year, winning the 2005 NCAA sabre title and becoming Columbia’s first female athlete to win an individual championship since 1990. It was a great start to an illustrious national career, as Jacobson would never finish lower than third at the NCAA Championships. As a result, she became one of two female fencers at Columbia to be a four-time first-team All-American. –Robert Gao </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>2008: Erinn Smart’s Columbia career and Olympic medal</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Erinn Smart, BC ’01, made Columbia history on a global stage.

As the individual Ivy League champion, Sara Ovadia, CC ’09, led the Lions to their first team title in program history. Ovadia’s success was not a surprise, given her impressive golfing resume and the California native’s status as No. 24 in the US for Women’s Amateurs. – Alexander Kwok </p> <p class="g-body subhed">Lacrosse</p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>1998: Sara Brubaker beats Notre Dame with last second goal </b> </p> <div class="image-brubaker"> <img src="brubaker.2b79e0e6.jpeg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:3vh;"> Photo courtesy of Columbia Daily Spectator Archives </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> During the 1998 women’s lacrosse season, the new Columbia program was tied with Notre Dame with only 30 seconds left on the clock.

A senior co-captain in 2004, Moll continued her scoring spree and netted five goals in the season opener that helped the Lions rally and beat Wagner College in overtime. – Sydney Stoller </p> <p class="g-body subhed">Rowing</p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>2004: Stacey Borgman wins women’s lightweight double skulls at the Olympics in Athens </b> </p> <div class="image-borgman"> <img src="borgman.db78cdc8.jpeg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:3vh;"> Photo courtesy of Columbia Athletics </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Stacey Borgman, BC ’98, began her path to greatness during her sophomore year at Barnard when, at the request of her mother, she walked onto the rowing team, even though she had never set foot in a scull.

However, the highlight of her career came in 2004, when she competed for the U.S. women’s rowing team in Athens at the Olympics. As the first Columbia women’s rowing alumnus to compete in the Olympics, Borgman won the women’s lightweight double sculls.
